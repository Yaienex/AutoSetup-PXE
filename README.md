# AutoSetup-PXE
Welcome on this repo. I wrote a short script to install a PXE and it will propose Ubuntu 24.04 desktop to be downloaded

There is only one OS for the need of my association [MiNET](http://minet.net/en) but if a lot of people ask me to I will add those to the installer

Enjoy your PXE !
